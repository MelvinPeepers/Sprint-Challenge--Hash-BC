Given a package with a weight limit limit and a list weights of item weights, implement a function get_indices_of_item_weights 
that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit limit. Your function will return an instance of an Answer tuple 
that has the following form:

    (zero, one)

The higher valued index should be placed in the zeroth index and the smaller index should be placed in the first index.

If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return None.

NOTE: When calling hash_table_retrieve with a key that doesn't exist in the hash table, hash_table_retrieve will return None.

Your solution should run in linear time.

Example:

input: weights = [ 4, 6, 10, 15, 16 ], length = 5, limit = 21
output: [ 3, 1 ]  # since these are the indices of weights 15 and 6 whose sum equals 21

UPER

So I have a hashtables.py to use
I'll need to iteriate through the length
I'll need to retrieve and insert
I'll need to get the indicies of the items weight who's sum equals the limit
